# TS3Monitor

Monitor your TeamSpeak 3 / TSDNS server instances using **TS3Monitor**.

It will check the status of your TeamSpeak 3 / TSDNS server instance and if it has crashed, it will try to restart it.

The **TS3Monitor** provides you also an autostart feature of the configured instances after a reboot or crash of the entire Root server/VPS/virtual machine.

  - bash (GNU Bourne Again SHell)
  - which
  - grep (GNU grep, egrep and fgrep)

- TeamSpeak DNS (TSDNS)
- [TS3UpdateScript](https://github.com/TS3Tools/TS3UpdateScript/)

## Installation

Download the latest version of this script to your Linux server:

``wget https://github.com/TS3Tools/TS3Monitor/archive/master.zip``

Unzip it:

``unzip master.zip``

Make the script executable:

``chmod +x TS3Monitor``

Configure it by editing the ``configs/config.all`` file using a text editor of your choice like ``nano`` or ``vim``:

``vim configs/config.all``

Next, add a cronjob using the parameter ``--install-cronjob``:

``./TS3Monitor ts3server --path /home/teamspeak/ --install-cronjob``

``./TS3Monitor tsdnsserver --path /home/teamspeak/tsdns/ --install-cronjob``

You can adjust the cronjob by editing the cron file ``/etc/cron.d/TS3Monitor``:

``*/5 * * * * bash /root/TS3Monitor-master/TS3Monitor ts3server --path /home/teamspeak/``

The above example would install a cronjob, which checks every 5 minutes the status of the ``ts3server`` in ``/home/teamspeak/``.

``*/5 * * * * bash /root/TS3Monitor-master/TS3Monitor tsdns --path /home/teamspeak/tsdns/``

The above example would install a cronjob, which checks every 5 minutes the status of the ``tsdnsserver`` in ``/home/teamspeak/tsdns/``.

The below example would check every single minute (every 60 seconds) the status of the ``ts3server`` in ``/home/teamspeak/``.

``* * * * * bash /root/TS3Monitor-master/TS3Monitor ts3server --path /home/teamspeak/``
